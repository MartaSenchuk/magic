	<p>On the far-far remoted planet, you can meet a tiny little girl, named Luli. She lives on a mysterious planet, where space and stars gently touch the horizon of a crystal blue ocean. On this planet, you can hear the songs of fantastic colorful birds, and meet pink dolphins, tiny blue-light whales, and adorable furry creatures, for example, the fox that is covered with a blue flame, and lemures that might become invisible, small wild cats, that can change their colors, depends on their mood.  The air is full of coconut oil scent, mixed with the salt ocean breeze. Clear sand, covers the surface, is sparkling whenever starsâ€™ light reaches the beach. 
She is an alien, who is the one and only citizen of a huge island, called Wanderlust. Nobody knows how she reaches the planet, but only she knows her life purpose. 
One night she has a dream, lighting strikes the beach, and on that spot, she sees a golden mirror, that is turned to be a portal to an unknown planet called Earth. She was told in her dream that she should visit Earth every night and sing songs for people from the planet. Lilu was confused because she did not understand the strange message, but the next morning she decided to try to use a portal.
